# Parking-Lot-Occupancy-Detection-
Developed a Wireless sensor network that will detect the number of available parking spaces available in a Parking lot and updates the available parking spaces to www.dropbox.com.
Used a pair of MS310 motes equipped with photo sensors to place at the entrance and exit locations to sense the number of vehicles entering and leaving the lot.
NesC programming (Specific for Wireless Sensor Motes) for sensing and JAVA code are used for uploading to Dropbox. 
A base station (another MS310 mote) continuously updates the occupancy and free spaces over the Internet in real time to a Dropbox account.
